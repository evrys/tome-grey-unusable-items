[Grey Out Unusable Items](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2600771038)

Addon for Tales of Maj'Eyal. Shows inventory items in dark grey if they have a power source incompatible with your character.

Arcane items are greyed out for antimagic characters, and arcane disrupting items are greyed out for characters with arcane abilities. Never accidentally break your spells again!
