[Grey Out Unusable Items](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2600771038)

This addon shows inventory items in dark grey if they have a power source incompatible with your character.

Arcane items are greyed out for antimagic characters, and arcane disrupting items are greyed out for characters with arcane abilities. Never accidentally wear a troublesome hat again!
